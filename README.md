LaTeXBox
=====

-------
**Important:** I guess LaTeXBox has finished its historical goal after the
LaTeX syntax has [merged](https://github.com/sublimehq/Packages/pull/370) into
Sublime Text. Additionally, the rapid recent development of
[LaTeXTools](https://github.com/SublimeText/LaTeXTools) shames the lake of
functionalities of LaTeXBox. Sorry guys, I am giving up LaTeXBox and switch
to LaTeXTools (and you should too).

For those who loves the keybinds shipped by LaTeXBox, I have moved the keybinds to a new package [LaTeXZeta](https://github.com/randy3k/LaTeXZeta) which is compartiable with LaTeXTools.

If you have a strong interest to be a maintainer of LaTeXBox, please let me know.

LaTeXBox is a multi-platform LaTeX package for [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3). 
It works on OSX, Windows and Linux. LaTeXBox aims to be lightweight, extensible but self contained. If
you are looking for a full feature package, see, for example
[LaTeXing](http://latexing.com) or
[LaTeXTools](https://github.com/SublimeText/LaTeXTools). A lot of ideas are
actually inspired by these two packages. So why this package? If you love
customization or want to be able to hack somethings, this package would be
your choice as LaTeXing is not open source and LaTeXTools is too bulky.

### Sublime Text 2 compatibility

While it is possible to backward port to ST2,  I would rather keep it ST3 only for easier maintenance.
